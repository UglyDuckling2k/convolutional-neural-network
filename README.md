# Project Overview

This project involves the development and training of a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification. Specifically, the model is designed to categorize real-life images of dogs and cats. This capability allows for a wide range of applications, including automated sorting of images, enhancing search functionalities in photo libraries, and aiding in the development of pet recognition software. The model architecture and training scripts are located in the `model` directory.
